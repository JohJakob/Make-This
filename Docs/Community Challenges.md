Try making this, so it’s all still fully vector and editable. Use whichever design tool you’d like. The checkerboard is just there to show transparency.

Rules: No bitmaps. Be careful about the diagonal edge — you can’t just build the halves with different layers, or use a gradient for it. Use any tool you’d like. Sketch? Photoshop? CSS? Great! Anything goes.
