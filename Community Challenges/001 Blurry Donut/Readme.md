#### Blurry Donut

Try making this, so it’s all still fully vector and editable. Use whichever design tool you’d like. The checkerboard is just there to show transparency.

Rules: No bitmaps. Be careful about the diagonal edge — you can’t just build the halves with different layers, or use a gradient for it.

Use any tool you’d like. Sketch? Photoshop? CSS? Great! Anything goes.

#### Specifications

It doesn’t matter if the artwork matches the original challenge perfectly, but if you’d like to, here’s the specs.

- The blurry circle is 200×200px, and #e5e5e5.
- The inner circle is 100×100px.
- The red section is #ff3351.
